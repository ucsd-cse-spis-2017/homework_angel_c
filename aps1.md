Problem 1
  (a) Since there are 33 coins by dividing it in half you will have a coin left over and if the sides are equal then the coin leftover is the counterfeit one. However, if they are not equal then the lighter one has the counterfeit and you would just keep dividing until you got the base case of 1 coin. So, the next step would be to then divide the 16 into 8 coins and the one lighter contains the fake coin. Next, divide the 8 into 4 coins and the one lighter has the fake coin. Finally, divide the 4 coins into 2 coins and take the lighter pile until worst case where you need an extra step to find the fake coin. In the worst case, 6 weighings are needed to identify the fake coin.
