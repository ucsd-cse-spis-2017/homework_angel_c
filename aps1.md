Problem 1
  (a) Since there are 33 coins by dividing it in half you will have a coin left over and if the sides are equal then the coin leftover is the counterfeit one. However, if they are not equal then the lighter one has the counterfeit and you would just keep dividing until you got the base case of 1 coin. So, the next step would be to then divide the 16 into 8 coins and the one lighter contains the fake coin. Next, divide the 8 into 4 coins and the one lighter has the fake coin. Finally, divide the 4 coins into 2 coins and take the lighter pile until worst case where you need an extra step to find the fake coin. In the worst case, 6 weighings are needed to identify the fake coin.
  (b) To find the fake coin you would use [log2(n)] if there are an n number of coins. 
Problem 2
  The Algorithm for multiplying two 6 digit numbers is as follows: using numbers such as 342,652 and 642,530 and splitting the numbers into four 3 digit numbers and inserting zeros to those 
  
 Problem 3 DNF
