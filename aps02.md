Problem 1: Making Change
An algorithm that finds the smallest set of coins of value exactly n is first set n/8 equal to the number of octals and take the remainder and equal it to n. Second, set n/5 equal to the number of nickels and take the remainder and equal it to n. Third, set n/1 equal to the number of pennies and don't take the remainder because this will allow it to be the smallest set of coins.

Problem 2: Least Expensive Path 




Problem 3: Longest Common Subsequence
