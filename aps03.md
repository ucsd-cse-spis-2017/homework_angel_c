Question 1: Using the greedy method, you would use the largest coins as possible to find the smallest set of coins of value exactly n. An algorithm is to use the quarters first because having the highest value from the coins it covers less than just two dimes and a nickel or how ever many pennies. The same can be applied to dimes because a dime covers less than two nickels or how ever many pennies. Finally, even for nickels it is the same because a nickel covers less than five pennies. So to find the smallest set it is better to start with the highest value coin using the greedy method.
